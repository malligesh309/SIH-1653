 GLOBAL PARTICIPATION
## Problem Description
Global participation in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) has become a significant aspect of the event, reflecting its growing international appeal and recognition. While the hackathon was initially focused on Indian students, it has increasingly attracted participants from across the world, fostering a spirit of global collaboration. Universities and colleges from various countries, especially those with a strong focus on technology and innovation, encourage their students to take part in the hackathon. This international involvement enriches the competition by bringing diverse perspectives and solutions to the table, helping address challenges with a more global outlook. The opportunity to work on real-world problems, often in collaboration with industry experts and government officials, also serves as a valuable platform for international students to showcase their talents. Additionally, it helps build cross-cultural networks and provides participants with exposure to India's unique challenges, encouraging the exchange of ideas and potential future collaborations. Global participation in SIH ultimately strengthens the event's impact, making it a truly international innovation hub.
